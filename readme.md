## Description
The Laser Dye Project merges alternative photography with digital fabrication by producing cyanotype (New Cyanotype and Vandyke Brown) images on sewn garments constructed from natural fibers or delicate and slightly uneven organic substrates through maskless laser exposure with a DIY programmable laser galvanometer system. The maskless development approach also broadens the potential to work with large exposure areas and enables printing with multiple laser machines from different angles.

This project has won the **Selected Work** title of **YouFab Global Award (2015)** and has been selected as one of the **Top 50 works of YouFab** and **Top 10 selected works of Reshape 2019**. It also won the **First Prize of Reshape 19** and a **Digital Fabrication Prize at Rome Fashion Week (Altaroma 2020)**, presented by **Fondazione Mondo Digitale**. 

Another related laser dye project, **"If Time Was Wearable and Foldable"**, was a collaboration with fashion designer **Yiyu Chen** and photographer **Bo-Lin Lo**. Yiyu Chen designed a garment with a special square pattern to experiment with the optical properties of laser dye, enabling textile printing with an origami-like structure.

#The amplifier board
The amplifier board is simply converting the output of teensy audio adaptor board to differential signals to adapt the +/- 5V inputs of galvos. For more details please visit:
